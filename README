Hello everyone, i want to learn Angular and NestJs stack, so i initialized this project.
A clone of linkedin, mainly about the features i'm interested like Auth, RealTime chat and infinite scroll in feed page.

I'll also try to use Postgres because i always used Mysql or MariaDB.
I'll work in this project in my free time.

Welcome here.
